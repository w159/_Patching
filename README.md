# \_Patching

Collection of custom PowerShell scripts intended to automate patching of vulnerable applications
These scripts are designed to use the vendor's own information to ensure the applications are up to date
This is intended to be used as a method to allow the continuous deployment of these scripts

IMPORTANT NOTE: While there's been extensive checks and testing on the vendor information. Should
a vendor make changes to their API's or URL's, they will likely break some of these scripts. As always,
please be sure to thoroughly test and verify before running on a production environment.
